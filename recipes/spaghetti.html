        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This classic Italian pasta dish combines a silky cheese sauce with crisp pancetta and black pepper.</p>
        <p>It is a staple food of traditional Italian cuisine. Like other pasta, spaghetti is made of milled wheat, water, and sometimes enriched with vitamins and minerals.</p>

        <h4>INGREDIENTS</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound lean ground meat like beef, turkey, chicken or lamb</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 cup (130 grams) chopped onion</li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves, minced (1 tablespoon)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>Pinch crushed red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>1 cup water, broth or dry red wine</li>
            <li>1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>Salt and fresh ground black pepper</li>
            <li>Handful fresh basil leaves, plus more for serving</li>
            <li>12 ounces dried spaghetti or favorite pasta shape</li>
            <li>1/2 cup shredded parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>STEPS</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat (we use a Dutch oven). 
                Add the meat and cook until browned, about 8 minutes. As the meat cooks, use a wooden spoon to break it up into smaller crumbles.
            </li>

            <li>Add the onions and cook, stirring every once and a while, until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
                
            <li>Stir in the garlic, tomato paste, oregano, and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring continuously for about 1 minute.</li>
                
            <li>Pour in the water and use a wooden spoon to scrape up any bits of meat or onion stuck to the bottom of the pot.
                Stir in the tomatoes, 3/4 teaspoon of salt, and a generous pinch of black pepper. Bring the sauce to a low simmer.
                Cook, uncovered, at a low simmer for 25 minutes. 
                As it cooks, stir and taste the sauce a few times so you can adjust the seasoning accordingly (see notes for suggestions).</li>
